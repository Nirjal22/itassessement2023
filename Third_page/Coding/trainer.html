            <p class="para">Conor McGregor, a former two-division UFC champion and
                one of the most popular fighters in mixed martial arts, has
                also ventured into the world of coaching. In recent years,
                McGregor has established himself as a UFC trainer, working
                with up-and-coming fighters at his gym, SBG Ireland. <br> <br>

                McGregor's coaching style is focused on developing his
                fighters' striking abilities, particularly their boxing and
                kickboxing skills. He is known for his emphasis on precision
                and timing, as well as his ability to motivate and inspire his
                fighters. <br> <br>

                Some of the fighters McGregor has trained include Artem
                Lobov, who competed on The Ultimate Fighter and in the
                UFC, and James Gallagher, who has achieved success in
                Bellator MMA. <br> <br>

                While McGregor's coaching career is still relatively young,
                his success as a fighter and his knowledge of striking have
                earned him respect in the coaching community. It will be
                interesting to see how his coaching career develops in the
                future.</p>

                Floyd Mayweather Jr. is widely regarded as one
                of the greatest boxers of all time, with an
                undefeated professional record of 50 wins and
                0 losses. In recent years, he has also
                established himself as a successful boxing
                trainer, working with a number of high-profile
                fighters.
                <br> <br>

                Mayweather's approach to training is focused
                on discipline, hard work, and attention to
                detail. He emphasizes the importance of
                physical conditioning, technical skills, and
                mental toughness in his training programs.
                Mayweather also places a strong emphasis on
                defense, teaching his fighters how to avoid
                punches and counter effectively.
                <br> <br>

                As a trainer, Mayweather has had notable
                success, with several of his fighters achieving
                championship titles. Some of the fighters he
                has trained include Gervonta Davis, Badou
                Jack, and Andrew Tate.
